PROFILE GENERATION APP

Our application makes use of three different API's in order to produce randomized user profiles with photos and names.
Users will be prompted to input gender and age data to generate a unique profile. Users may also save their input to local storage so that previously generated profiles can be retrieved.

The opening page of the application includes the input fields as well as buttons to "Generate Profile", "Save Input", and "Generate Saved".

The "Generate Profile" button will create a new profile based upon the data in the input fields.

The "Save Input" button utilizes the local storage to save the parameters created by the input fields.

Clicking on the "Generate Saved" button will retrieve the latest generated user profile.

When a new profile is generated the user is provided with the options to created another profile based upon new data by clicking the "New Profile" button, generate another profile name and photo using the current parameters by clicking the "Generate" button, or to retrieve the previously generated profile by clicking on the "Generate Saved" button .
